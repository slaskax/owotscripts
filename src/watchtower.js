/* fern's "Watchtower" script (version 3.2)
 * This is a simple script listens on the active WebSocket for tileUpdate messages.
 * After it recieves such a message, it outputs the location of the update to the
 * console, or as a notification if the menu option is enabled. The primary purpose
 * of this script is so you can see where edits are happening on an OWOT world.
 * Please do not use this for malicious purposes.
 *
 * NOTICES:
 *     1. This script has a known "off-by-one" bug. I have tried several times to fix it,
 *        but have not succeeded. If you find out how to fix it, *please* let me know.
 *     2. Enabling notifications can cause lag if there's a lot of updates happening
 *        in rapid succession.
 *     3. Due to an update to OWOT, only local updates are shown to the client, which
 *        renders this software deprecated; nevertheless, the file will be kept for
 *        historical preservation.
 *
 * CONTRIBUTIONS:
 *     - Vince0110 (added notifications)
