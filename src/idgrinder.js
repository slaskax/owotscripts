/* fern's ID Grinder (version 6)
 * 
 * I completely rewrote this from scratch because the original was so bad.
 * Here's a list of changes from the original version:
 *    - No longer freezes the whole tab until done.
 *    - Informs you in chat when it is done.
 *    - Has functions to easily stop and restart the grinder.
 *        - idg.stop() and idg.grind()
 * 
 * This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.
 * For more information, please refer to <http://unlicense.org/> */

/* This is the part of the code that determines whether or not an ID
 * should be kept or not. Overwrite this with the logic you want.
 * The example code below will simply keep any ID below 100.
 * 
 * If true is returned, it is kept; otherwise it is discarded. */
function isGood(id) {
    return id < 100;
}

/* The idg namespace that all the primary logic is stored inside of.
 *
 * The casual user does not need to worry about how any of this works,
 * but feel free to take a peek anyway if you're curious. */
