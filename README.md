# My OWOT scripts.
I made this repo to store various small OWOT ([Our World of Text](https://ourworldoftext.com/)) scripts I've made. If a
script grows too large or requires multiple files to work, it will be moved to its own directory. All scripts are under 
the Unlicense unless otherwise stated.
> Note: If you're not sure who I am, on OWOT I usually go by the alias *fernsy*.
